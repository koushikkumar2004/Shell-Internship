# Week-1
This project analyzes the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) dataset (2000–2022) to study progress across countries and years. It explores how individual SDG goal scores (Goal 1–17) contribute to the overall SDG Index Score, and applies machine learning models to predict sustainability progress.
